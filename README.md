# Analysis of sports and non-sport factors on the market value of a football player
The project analyses sporting and non-sporting factors that are crucial in assessing the market value of a football player for the years 2022 and 2023. 
A linear regression model is then constructed to determine which coefficients have the greatest impact on market value. The data has been collected from footystats.org.
Data science steps followed in this project are Data Pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Modelling and Prediction.

**Data Source** : footystats.org

**Python Libraries used**
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Pygal_maps_world

**Pre-processing operations**
1. Checking for missing values in dataset
2. Checking for duplicate values in dataset
3. Shortening player names to make them more visible

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
1. View a graph of the 50 most valuable players in the world
2. Analysis of the factors which have an impact on a player's value
    - league
    - position on the field
    - country of origin
    - age
    - goals
    - assists
    - key passes
    - dribblings
    - goal involvement
4. How the most valuable player compareto the Ballon D'or award
6. Comparison of value between June 2022 and June 2023

**Data Modelling**
1. Build a graphical presentation of players market value and sporting or non-sporting variables
2. Model of linear regression
3. Determination of the coefficients influencing the market values
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model
